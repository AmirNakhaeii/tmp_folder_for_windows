Temporary directory for windows

</br>

**I thought to myself, as we have a temporary (tmp) directory in Linux, why not in Windows? When the computer restarts, all contents of this directory will be deleted.**

## How to make tmp folder
run commands

```bash
python install.py
```

*This command will first create a folder named 'tmp' on your desktop and then copy main.exe to the startup folder and when you restart your computer this file will be executed and removes the old tmp folder and creates a new tmp folder.*

**To make *main.exe* you must to use the tool for converting *main.py* file to exe file for do that [Click here](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe/)**
